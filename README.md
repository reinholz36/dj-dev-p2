## User Story

1. As a User, I want a secure way to record and track my dreams over time to see if there are any patterns or mysteries revealed.
2. When I click Add Journal Entry I would like to be prompted with questions like how I'm feeling, the title of the dream, and place to enter a full description.
3. When I submit an entry I would like for a date tag to be added along with the title and emoji to past entries for later reference.
4. When I click on a past journal entry I would like to see the full dream details.
