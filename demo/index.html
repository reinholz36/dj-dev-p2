          <p class="card-text">I was at church and I did not have a church newsletter I just had a normal book so when I was asked to read a prayer out loud by my sister from my seat I couldn’t and then I was embarrassed. Then I left church early but nobody else came out and I waited and it turned out everybody was late out because they all got to make their own profiteroles and chocolate from scratch. I was so jealous and I was craving profiteroles and thinking how could I make them at home. Then I ran away and everyone was worried about me.</p>

          <p class="card-text">I was restless throughout the night so I had a few dreams. There was a big race I was watching on a running track, both on foot and with transports, including a bubble car you peddle yourself from my childhood. I was then a time traveller who had come back to warn people of things that were going to happen. A guy I was with once in college told me he loved me. I was at dinner speaking Spanish to someone. My Medium article got published, dreaming of my Medium stats and notifications because it was the last thing I dID before I went to sleep.</p>
